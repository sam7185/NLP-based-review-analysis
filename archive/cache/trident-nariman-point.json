      "text": "I wrote this to their management. Received the feedback in person and on phone calls.\n1) I checked in on 05-06-2025: I was literally shocked with the behaviour of chauffeurs at the main gate who didn’t bother to help with the luggage and despite asking for help, I had pick up my luggage despite asking for help. This was around 2347 hours. I mentioned the issue at the check-in counter. I somehow let it go, as I may understand that your personnel might be busy. I felt odd but as mentioned, I let it go.\n2) On 06-Jun-2025: I had dinner in Frangpani restaurant and ordered mutton kala sukkha (something like that) and risotto. I got mostly bones in the mutton and risotto was absolutely not up to the mark. The issue was notified and the chef acknowledged the shortcomings and offered a discount. However, me and my partner refused not to accept the discount, as we were there for quality time. My objective was to send a feedback so that they do not ruin other customer’s moment of leisure. I let it go.\n3) On 07-06-2025, 2 incidents happened:\ni) During the breakfast time at Maxican Room, your employee passed on a racist comment targeting my partner among his colleague which I overheard. This was unacceptable and at this moment, I couldn’t let it go. I reported it.\nYour employee accepted what he said and apologised but it ruined the entire feel of having a quality time at your 5 star hotel.\nii) I ordered food at 21:00 hours for Dinner and the entire order came in parts, first part came in 30-40 min post ordering ( I also informed the in-house dinning guy that I will be waiting for the second part). The second part of the order came at 2230 hours. I had to return the order as the first part got cold and the quality has been reduced as expected. The manager confirmed that they missed it. My partner and me had to return back without food and due to late arrival of meal my partner had minor gastrointestinal issues, which is being taken care now.",
