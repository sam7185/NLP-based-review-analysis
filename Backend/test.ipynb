Received the feedback in person and on phone calls.\\n1) I checked in on 05-06-2025: I was literally shocked with the behaviour of chauffeurs at the main gate who didn’t bother to help with the luggage and despite asking for help, I had pick up my luggage despite asking for help. This was around 2347 hours. I mentioned the issue at the check-in counter. I somehow let it go, as I may understand that your personnel might be busy. I felt odd but as mentioned, I let it go.\\n2) On 06-Jun-2025: I had dinner in Frangpani restaurant and ordered mutton kala sukkha (something like that) and risotto. I got mostly bones in the mutton and risotto was absolutely not up to the mark. The issue was notified and the chef acknowledged the shortcomings and offered a discount. However, me and my partner refused not to accept the discount, as we were there for quality time. My objective was to send a feedback so that they do not ruin other customer’s moment of leisure. I let it go.\\n3) On 07-06-2025, 2 incidents happened:\\ni) During the breakfast time at Maxican Room, your employee passed on a racist comment targeting my partner among his colleague which I overheard. This was unacceptable and at this moment, I couldn’t let it go. I reported it.\\nYour employee accepted what he said and apologised but it ruined the entire feel of having a quality time at your 5 star hotel.\\nii) I ordered food at 21:00 hours for Dinner and the entire order came in parts, first part came in 30-40 min post ordering ( I also informed the in-house dinning guy that I will be waiting for the second part). The second part of the order came at 2230 hours. I had to return the order as the first part got cold and the quality has been reduced as expected. The manager confirmed that they missed it. My partner and me had to return back without food and due to late arrival of meal my partner had minor gastrointestinal issues, which is being taken care now.\",\n",

It would be helpful if the staff ensured a more organized system where ongoing check-ins are prioritized, and others are politely asked to wait.\\n* Service Equality: I couldn’t help but notice a difference in attentiveness toward foreign guests compared to others.

The thoughtful gestures—like surprising our kids with complimentary chocolates and cupcakes—truly elevated our experience.\\rEvery staff member we interacted with, from valet parking to security, reception, the welcoming committee, room service, restaurant, and lounge teams, was courteous and genuinely hospitable. Even Dattaram, the attendant at the lobby-level washroom, impressed us with his professionalism and warmth.\\rIt’s these little moments and genuine interactions that create lifelong memories. Thank you to the entire team for making our stay so special. The room size could have been bigger, especially the bathroom. It was a bit cramped, not soundproof, and the bathtub was too small to accommodate someone like me!\",\n",

Our room was beautiful and had all the facilities that we could require. The breakfast was also lovely and had extensive options. We also offered room service which was good, and staff on a whole were very friendly and helpful. We did have one issue during our stay that needs addressing. The hotel is geared towards hosting large weddings, and while we understand that these bring in significant income, it is important that other guests are not overlooked. At times, it felt as though we were secondary to the wedding events.\\rThe main issue was that my friend wanted to use an outdoor area to smoke while having a drink. There were contradictory instructions from staff about where she could go, which resulted in her either being hidden around the corner from the pool or outside the front lobby where all the cars pull in—without a chair and made to feel like an inconvenience.\\rWe queried this with staff and received varying responses, but were eventually told that the pool area is the designated smoking area, although it wasn't always accessible. On those occasions, the facilities and atmosphere fell short of a five-star experience.\",\n",
